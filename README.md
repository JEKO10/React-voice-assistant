## Project task

I created text and voice translator using React, Alan AI and Libretranslate API.

## Project overview

Design is similar to a Google translate. You are able to choose between more than 25 different languages, including English, Chinese, Arabic, German, Italian, Spanish, etc. All you have to do is to click the blue button in the bottom right corner, and say 'Translate' then _your sentence_. I used context as app provider. Alan button and state, which takes text or voice, are set up in context. I used Libretranslate API for translating text and voice. For getting languages,posting text using API parameters and getting translated text I used axios.
